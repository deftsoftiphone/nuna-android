<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Your Relationship with Us</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>This document and any documents referred to within it (collectively, the &ldquo;Terms of Use&rdquo;) set out the terms of your relationship with us. It is important that you read and understand the Terms of Use before using the Service. If there is anything within them that you do not understand, then please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@nuna.app">support@nuna.app</a>&nbsp;to discuss what this means for you.</li>
    <li>By setting up an account with us and/or using and accessing the Service, you agree to and accept these Terms of Use in their entirety. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not use the Service.</li>

<p><strong>3. Information About You And Your Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. You should read our Privacy Policy to understand how we collect, use and share information about you.</p>
<p><strong>4. Setting Up an Account</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>To access our Service, you must register with us and set up an account with a username and password (your &ldquo;Account&rdquo;). We encourage you to use &ldquo;strong&rdquo; passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your Account.</li>
    <li>You must be at least 13 years of age and <strong>capable in your country of residence of entering into a legally binding agreement to use our Service</strong>. Nuna does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from providing any personal information to the Site. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login details and any activities that occur under your Account. If you have any concerns that your Account may have been misused, you should contact us at <a href="mailto:support@nuna.app">support@nuna.app</a>&nbsp;straight away to let us know.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;Marketplace &amp; Payments</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Our Service allows you to buy and sell items.</li>
    <li>You can sell your items through our Service by publishing pictures/videos of the item you want to sell (&ldquo;Sale Item&rdquo;). When a user of the Service purchases such Sale Item, this is a &ldquo;Sale Transaction&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>Sale Transactions may only take place via either of Nuna&rsquo;s third party payment providers (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;TPP&rdquo;) - PayTM, GooglePay and PhonePe.</li>
    <li>Where you use TPP to make or receive payment for a Sale Transaction, you will need a TPP account to use the Service. If you are under 18 and do not have your own TPP account, and plan to use a parent&rsquo;s or any other party&rsquo;s TPP account, you undertake that you have express permission to use such parent&rsquo;s or any other party&rsquo;s TPP account in relation to each and every transaction undertaken on our Service.</li>
    <li>To safeguard the interests of our users, you are not permitted to sell or purchase a Sale Item by making direct arrangements with the buyer or the seller to use a payment method other than the payment methods offered via the Service. Please note that selling or purchasing a Sale Item in any other way is a breach of our Rules of Acceptable Use and can result in, among other things, suspension or termination of your access to the Service (See section 8).</li>
    <li>Any agreement for and/or purchase of a Sale Item is made solely between you and the seller. The Application may include functionality for suggesting more effective selling, such as discounting Sale Items, but Sellers have, at all times, total discretion to set prices. Complaints, questions and claims related to a Sale Item should be directed to the seller.</li>
    <li>As we are not the seller of any Sale Items, we have no control and do not give any commitment relating to the existence, quality, safety, genuineness or legality of Sale Items, the truth or accuracy of any picture or description of the Sale Items or any other content made available by users, the ability of sellers to sell Sale Items, the ability of buyers to pay for them or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return the Sale Item, and we have no liability in this respect. Sellers are responsible for ensuring that any age-restricted Sale Items are marked clearly with the applicable age restriction (as required by law) and Buyers agree that they shall not attempt to purchase Sale Items if they are younger than the advertised and legal age restriction.</li>
</ol>

    <li>User Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by us, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations.

The Infringement Notice should be sent either by post to 323E Mayur Vihar, Phase 2, New Delhi &ndash; 110091, India or by email to <a href="mailto:support@nuna.app">support@nuna.app</a>. Please provide the information described below in the Infringement Notice:</li>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li>your name and contact details;</li>
        <li>a statement explaining in sufficient detail why you consider that the content available through our Service infringes your rights or fails to comply with our Rules of Acceptable Use; and</li>
        <li>a link to or such other means of identifying the problematic content.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>We will take the action that we believe is appropriate depending on the nature of the Infringement Notice and will aim to respond to you within a reasonable period of time on the action we propose to take.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>10.&nbsp;Our liability/responsibility to you</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>You alone decide whether to proceed with a sale or purchase of a Sale Item. As such, we make no commitments regarding the Sale Items including the quality or delivery of the Sale Items, or for honouring (or causing any seller to honour) any erroneous information regarding the price, description and availability of, or any information relating to any Sale Items promoted or available through our Service, or the ability of the buyer to complete any purchase of the Sale Items.</li>
    <li>Although it is our intention that the Service is available as much as possible, there may be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including for scheduled maintenance, upgrades and emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunication links and/or equipment. The Service and any content contained therein (including User Content) is provided on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; and &ldquo;as is&rdquo; basis. This means that we are unable to promise that your use of the Service will be uninterrupted, without delays, error-free or meet your expectations and we do not give any commitment relating to the performance or availability of the Service in these Terms of Use and, to the extent we are able to do so, we exclude any commitments that may be implied by, or be expressed by, applicable law. You accept that the internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of User Content or other information may not be secure.</li>
    <li>Nuna is not responsible or liable for any loss or harm caused by viruses, worms or other programmes designed to impair the Service.</li>
    <li>You may be able to access third party links/websites/products via the Service. Nuna is not responsible or liable for any third party links/websites/products which may be accessed by you at your sole option. Your access to and use of such third party links/websites/products and services shall be solely at your own risk and subject to your acceptance and compliance with the separate terms and conditions of such third party.</li>
    <li>For any other claims arising out of the provision of the Service (including without limitation any dispute between users where this does not fall within paragraph 5 above, in relation to any content you access via the Service, or any other user you interact with), we do not accept any responsibility whatsoever (whether arising in contract, tort otherwise), except where we cannot disclaim, exclude or limit responsibility by law (such as death and/or personal injury caused by our negligence).</li>
    <li>We will never be responsible for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable and we will never be responsible for indirect losses and/or financial and business loss, or loss of goodwill or reputation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>11.&nbsp;Your Responsibility To Us</strong></p>
<p>If Nuna is sued due to an action or inaction by you (including a breach of these Terms of Use) then we have the right, at our discretion, to request that you indemnify us (i.e. cover all our costs including legal fees) and hold us harmless from any legal claim or demand for expenses or costs that arises as a result. Where we decide to conduct the defence of such claim, you agree to assist us as reasonably requested.</p>
<p><strong>12.&nbsp;Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and us in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and we agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with the Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</li>
    <li>The venue for arbitration shall be New Delhi, India.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>13.&nbsp;Indemnity</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Users agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Nuna, its employees, directors, officers, agents and their successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by or arising out of claims based upon your actions or inactions, which may result in any loss or liability to Nuna or any third party including but not limited to breach of any warranties, representations or undertakings or in relation to the non-fulfillment of any of your obligations under this Terms of Use or arising out of your violation of any applicable laws, regulations including but not limited to Intellectual Property Rights, payment of statutory dues and taxes, claim of libel, defamation, violation of rights of privacy or publicity, loss of service by other subscribers and infringement of intellectual property or other rights. This clause shall survive the expiry or termination of this Terms of Use.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>14.&nbsp;Termination</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>We may, at any time and without notice, suspend, cancel, or terminate your right to use the Application (or any portion of the Application). In the event of suspension, cancellation, or termination, you are no longer authorized to access the part of the Application affected by such suspension, cancellation, or termination. In the event of any suspension, cancellation, or termination, the restrictions imposed on you with respect to material downloaded from the Application, and the disclaimers and limitations of liabilities set forth in the Agreement, shall survive.</li>
    <li>Without limiting the foregoing, we may close, suspend or limit your access to your Account:</li>

        <li>if we determine that you have engaged, or are engaging, in fraudulent, or illegal activities;</li>
        <li>you do not respond to account verification requests;</li>
        <li>to manage any risk of loss to us, a User, or any other person; or</li>
        <li>For other similar reasons.</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>15.&nbsp;Governing Law &amp; Jurisdiction</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Republic of India without regard to its choice of law principles.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>16.&nbsp;Changes to these Terms of Use</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>We may revise these Terms of Use from time to time and any changes will take effect after 3 days of any notification email sent to you notifying you of any changes, or at the time the revised Terms of Use are posted (whichever is the earlier) and your continued use of the Service shall constitute acceptance of such revised Terms of Use.</li>
    <li>Changes will usually occur because of new features being added to the Service, changes in the law or where we need to clarify our position on something.</li>
    <li>We will try, where possible and reasonable, to contact you to let you know about any significant changes to any of the documents referred to in these Terms of Use. We may contact you through the Service (for example by asking you to accept the changes before you continue to use the Service) or via a separate email.</li>
    <li>Normally, we will try to give you some warning before the new terms become effective. However, sometimes changes will need to be made immediately and if this happens we will not give you any notice.</li>
