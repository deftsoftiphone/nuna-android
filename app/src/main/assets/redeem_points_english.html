<div>💰&nbsp;<strong>REDEEM LIKES FOR CASH</strong></div>
<div>Each Like received by a post you create can be redeemed for ₹1&nbsp;(1 Like =&nbsp;₹1). Follow the steps given below to redeem the number of Likes received ("Likes") on your Nuna account:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">👉 Create a PayTM account with the same phone number used to create your account on Nuna.</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">👉&nbsp;Send a WhatsApp text message to +91 96671 35355 with the following message: REDEEM LIKES</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">👉&nbsp;Nuna will calculate the number of valid "Likes", and transfer the associated cash amount in Indian Rupees (₹) to the PayTM account linked to the phone number, within 5 business days.</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">👉&nbsp;"Likes" can be redeemed only once. Any "Likes" that have been redeemed once will be excluded from any future redemption requests.</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">👉&nbsp;For each post, a minimum of&nbsp;10 "Likes" are needed for those "Likes" to be redeemable for cash. For example, if a post has&nbsp;9 "Likes",&nbsp;₹0 can be redeemed for that post. On the other hand, if a post has 11 "Likes",&nbsp;₹11 can be redeemed for that post.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
